    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective:\n",
    "The objective of this analysis is to investigate the relationships between various employee-related factors and attrition. We aim to perform a t-test to check for significant differences in monthly income between employees who left the company (`attrition = 'Yes'`) and those who stayed (`attrition = 'No'`). Additionally, regression analysis is performed to understand the relationship between job-related factors and monthly income.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology:\n",
    "1. **Data Collection**: The data is fetched from a PostgreSQL database using `SQLAlchemy` and `psycopg2` to connect to the database.\n",
    "2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Basic statistical analysis and correlation assessments were performed.\n",
    "3. **Hypothesis Testing**: A t-test is used to evaluate whether there is a significant difference in monthly income between employees who left and stayed.\n",
    "4. **Regression Analysis**: We used an OLS regression model to evaluate the impact of job level and years at the company on monthly income.\n",
